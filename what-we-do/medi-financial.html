            <h1>Nigeria's Medical Mission & Volunteerism</h1>
        </div>
        <p>The vision of CBHI is to provide intervention strategies,
             and support to the administration of preventive health 
             care services in Nigeria's underprivileged and rural communities,
              allowing vulnerable and poor individuals and families
               to achieve access to healthcare services.  To attain this,
                CBHI is taking leadership and resource mobilization role
                 in addressing the social and economic determinants
                  to health care as they impact individuals, families and communities.

 

            Ill health, in turn, is a major cause of poverty.
             This is partly due to the costs of seeking health care,
              which include not only out-of-pocket spending on care
               (such as consultations, tests and medicine), but also
                transportation costs and any informal payments to providers.
                 It is also due to the considerable loss of income associated
                  with illness in developing countries, both breadwinners,
                   but also of family members who may be obliged to stop
                    working or attending school to take care of an ill relative.
                     In addition, poor families coping with illness might
                      be forced to sell assets to cover medical expenses,
                       borrow at high interest rates or become indebted to the community.
            
            Strong health systems improve the health 
            status of the whole population, but especially
             of the poor among whom ill health and poor access
              to health care tends to be concentrated, as well
               as protect households from the potentially
                catastrophic effects of out-of-pocket health
                 care costs. In general, poor health is
                  disproportionately concentrated among the poor.
            
            Under the Medical Financial Assistance Program,
             CBHI offers health equity and financial protection
              to vulnerable families in poor and rural communities
               in Nigeria through a strategy known and identified
                as “preventing poverty due to illness (by improving financial protection).”

                Generally, this involves implementing various lawful
                 mechanisms that help sick families or individuals
                  overcome geographic, social and psychological
                   barriers to accessing care and reducing out-of-pocket
                    cost of treatment. Examples include:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Scouting for humanitarian intervention 
                            or raising awareness and special funds
                             to support the medical care of the patient
                              in critical care or with unique medical conditions.
                        </li>
                        <li>Reducing the direct cost of care at the point
                             of service, e.g. through reducing/abolishing
                              user fees for the poor or arranging provisional
                               and temporary health insurance to the poor 
                               (including coverage, depth and breadth).
                        </li>
                        <li>Expanding access to care by using the private sector or public-private partnerships.

                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    More importantly, the Medical Financial Assistance Program
                     is a resource to help critically ill and poverty-stricken
                      patients pay their healthcare cost or receive free medical
                       services CapacityBay Health Initiative's medical financial
                        assistance is offered to patients with limited or no resources
                         or inadequate medical insurance coverage. Eligibility is
                          determined by family income. The program also provides
                           financial assistance to low-income uninsured and underinsured
                            patients who are Nigerians and live in Nigeria and
                             with incomes up to 300% of the international poverty level.
