                In today's communication-rich environment including rural and poor communities in Nigeria, individuals and families look to many places for information about their health and safety.  Nevertheless, most of the available health and safety information out there is too technical, too complex, and visibly too elusive about recommended actions for poor and rural communities in Nigeria. CBHI will serve as an accessible source and promoter of accurate and actionable health and safety information to help the public as they try to:

                CBHI seeks the unique opportunity to serve as an accessible source of accurate and actionable health and safety information to help poor and rural communities as they try to do the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Prevent harm or disease</li>
                    <li>Understand diagnoses</li>
                    <li>Decide on treatments</li>
                    <li>Evaluate risks to their health</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                We also provide a framework and use clear communication and health literacy methods to benefit individuals and families in poor and rural communities. These actions are organized around three goals.
                <ol>
                    <li>Create and disseminate health and safety information that is accurate, accessible, and actionable for everyone in poor and rural communities in Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>Integrate clear communication and health literacy in public school education in poor and rural communities in Nigeria.</li>
                    <li>Incorporate accurate, standards-based, and developmentally appropriate health and science information and curricula in educational settings from childcare through university levels.</li>
                </ol>
